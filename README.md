# cse417 Introduction to Machine Learning


Washu CSE 417T
OVERVIEW
This course is an introduction to machine learning, focusing on supervised learning. We will cover the mathematical foundations of learning, a number of important techniques for classification and regression, including linear and logistic regression, neural networks, nearest neighbor techniques, kernel methods, decision trees, and ensemble methods, as well as some material on fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in machine learning. Note that the material in this course is a prerequisite for CSE 517A, the graduate level machine learning class. The overlap with CSE 511A (Artificial Intelligence) is minimal.
